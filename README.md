## Introduction

Welcome to SymAware, the Symbolic Logic Framework for Situational Awareness in Mixed Autonomy, a cutting-edge project funded by the European Union.
Imagine an environment where autonomous agents - be it robots, drones, or cars - collaborate seamlessly with humans to complete complex, dynamically evolving tasks.
SymAware is designed to equip these agents with the crucial capability of obtaining situational awareness and enhancing their risk perception abilities.

## Overview

This repository contains code of the `symaware-prescan` package, which is a part of the SymAware project.
The `symaware-prescan` package is a Python module that provides a simulation environment for the agents using [Prescan](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/simcenter/prescan.html).


## Requirements

- [Prescan (2024.1)](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/simcenter/prescan.html)
- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [CMake 3.21+](https://cmake.org/download/)
- c++ compiler
    - [mingw-w64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) **Tested**
    - [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) **Untested**
    - [Visual Studio 2019+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) **Untested**

## Installation

To install the package, ideally this command should be sufficient:

```bash
py -m pip install . --index-url https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/api/v4/projects/2668/packages/pypi/simple
```

Based on the machine and software versions, the installation might fail.
Here are some common issues and their solutions:

- **Incompatible python or Prescan version**: make sure you are using a supported version. Older versions of Prescan may be supported by changing the appropriate version parameter in the `CMakeLists.txt` file
- **Incompatible c++ compiler**: while all c++ compilers should work, some incompatibilities may still arise, especially for the untested ones. Please report them opening an issue
- **Prescan_base_DIR** in the `CMakeLists.txt` file should be updated to the correct path of the Prescan installation directory
- **pybind11** should have access to the shared libraries of the python distribution in use
- **mingw-w64** may need to run its own distribution of python in order to install the package

The executable needs some shared libraries (`ddls`) to be in the `PATH` environment variable. 
This can be done by using the following code snippets in the powershell console:

```powershell
# Update the path to the Prescan installation directory
$prescan_dir = "C:/Program Files/Simcenter Prescan/Prescan_2403" 
# The amount of folders depends on the installed plugins
$env:PATH += ";$prescan_dir/bin;$prescan_dir/Plugins/FullWaveformLidarPlugin/bin;$prescan_dir/Plugins/PBRadarPlugin/bin;$prescan_dir/Plugins/PointCloudLidarPlugin/bin;$prescan_dir/Plugins/ProbabilisticSensorsPlugin/bin;$prescan_dir/Plugins/V2XPlugin/bin"
```

or, in the command prompt:

```bat
@rem Update the path to the Prescan installation directory
set prescan_dir=C:/Program Files/Simcenter Prescan/Prescan_2403
@rem The amount of folders depends on the installed plugins
set PATH=%PATH%;%prescan_dir%/bin;%prescan_dir%/Plugins/FullWaveformLidarPlugin/bin;%prescan_dir%/Plugins/PBRadarPlugin/bin;%prescan_dir%/Plugins/PointCloudLidarPlugin/bin;%prescan_dir%/Plugins/ProbabilisticSensorsPlugin/bin;%prescan_dir%/Plugins/V2XPlugin/bin
```

before running the executable.
Python scripts shoud use the `os.add_dll_directory` function to achieve the same result before importing the `symaware.simulators.prescan`.
See the [example](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/sadegh/eicsymaware/-/blob/base/examples/prescan_main.py).

## Useful scripts

### ReBuild python bindings and format

```powershell
python3.11.exe -m pip uninstall symaware-prescan symaware-base -y ; rm  -r -fo 'C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\python3.11\site-packages\symaware' ; python3.11.exe -m pip install . --index-url https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/api/v4/projects/2668/packages/pypi/simple ; python3.11.exe .\script\stubs.py ; black python tests ; isort python tests ; cp .\python\symaware\simulators\prescan\_symaware_prescan.pyi 'C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\python3.11\site-packages\symaware\simulators\prescan'
```
